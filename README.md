# Test-Bullet DevContainer Project

This is a test project designed to simulate an issue encountered during the upgrade of the Bullet gem from version **8.0.1** to **8.0.3**. The project uses Ruby 3.3.7 inside a DevContainer and employs **minitest**, **rake**, **sqlite3**, and **bullet** along with **activerecord**.

The primary goal of this project is to test and reproduce the conditions where Bullet might behave unexpectedly after the upgrade, specifically in scenarios involving nested attributes and inverse associations.
